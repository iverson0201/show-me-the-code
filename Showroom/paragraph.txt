One day in a staff meeting in the Loudcloud/Opsware days, someone brought up an issue that had been bothering him for some time. ¡°This place is entirely too profane. It¡¯s making many of the employees uncomfortable.¡± Others chimed in: ¡°It makes the environment unprofessional. We need to put a stop to it.¡± Although the complaints were abstract, they were clearly directed at me since I was the biggest abuser of profanity in the company and perhaps in the industry. In those days, I directed the team with such urgency that it was rare for me to say more than a few sentences without an expletive injected somewhere.
